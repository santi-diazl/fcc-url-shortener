# [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/url-shortener-microservice)

A microservice that allows users to save URLs with a POST request to /api/shorturl and then retrieve and be redirected to the original URL with a GET request to /api/shorturl/<short_url>.

This [demo version](https://sdiaz-url-shortener.herokuapp.com/) will pass all 4 of FCC's [required user stories](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice).
